# Temperature-Converter
Create a GUI that converts fahrenheit to celsius and vice versa. GUI stands for **Graphical User Interface**.

## Instructions
1. Begin by drawing 3 different wireframes for the GUI. After creating 3 different wireframes, choose which one is the best. Don't forget to commit and push to your repository.
2. Create a python file (.py) named **temperature.py**. 
3. Create a GUI with the widgets needed. Widgets include: **Entry** for number to enter, **Button** to convert the number entered, **Label** for displaying the number entered. Extra [widgets](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_gui_programming.htm) are up to you.
4. Add the functions necessary to convert the number entered from *fahrenheit to celsius* and vice versa.
5. Commit changes and push when finished.
